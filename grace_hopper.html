  <strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong> (December 9, 1906 -January 1, 1992), <strong>Grace Brewster Murray</strong>, was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank"> computer scientist</a> and United States Navy Rear Admiral.
She was one of the first programmers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I" target="_blank"> Harvard Mark I</a> computer in 1944, invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who
popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages which led to the development of <strong>COBOL</strong>, one of the first <em>high-level programming languages</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace". The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer <strong>USS Hopper
(DDG-70)</strong> is named for her, as is the <strong>Cray XE6 "Hopper"</strong> supercomputer at <strong>NERSC</strong>.

  <h1 id="earlyLife">Early life and education</h1>
  <p>
    Hopper was born in New York City. She was the oldest in a family of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Dutch and
  Scottish descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during
  the Civil War.

    Grace was curious as a child, a lifelong trait: at the age of seven she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked, and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother
  realized what she was doing. For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Rejected for early admission to Vassar College at
  age 16, she was admitted the following year. <strong>She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her
  master's degree at Yale University in 1930</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of 0ystein Ore. Her dissertation, <em>New Types of Irreducibility Criteria</em>, was published that same year.
  Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.

<h2 id="worldWar">World War II</h2>
<p>
  In 1943, during World War II, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve, one of many women to volunteer to serve in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAVES">WAVES</a>. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds. She reported in December and trained at the Naval
Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the <em>Bureau of Ships
Computation Project</em> at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">Howard H. Aiken</a>. Hopper and Aiken
coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was
declined due to her age (38). <strong>She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until1949, turning down a full professorship
at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard</strong>.
</p>
<h2 id="cobol">COBOL</h2>
<p>
  In the spring of 1959, a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL} brought together computer experts from industry and
government. Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language
<strong>COBOL</strong> (an acronym for <strong>CO</strong>mmon <strong>B</strong>usiness-<strong>O</strong>riented <strong>L</strong>anguage). <strong>The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent,
COMTRAN. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English {rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine
code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the
rank of Captain in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.

a moth flies out of the computer.</li>
